# Arduino Based Autonomous-Shopping-Cart

This project involves the development of an Arduino-based autonomous shopping cart designed to enhance the shopping experience. Equipped with sensors, cameras, and a robotic arm, the cart is capable of detecting, gripping, and placing items into the cart. The robotic arm uses precision sensors to identify products on shelves, ensuring accurate selection and handling.

The system is also designed to navigate store paths autonomously, detect obstacles, and avoid collisions, ensuring smooth movement through aisles. Integrated with a mobile app, it provides a fully automated, efficient, and contactless shopping experience. This innovative solution aims to reduce the time spent shopping and improve overall convenience.
